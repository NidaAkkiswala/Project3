	  </div>
	  <p>Hello! My name is Nida Akkiswala, a 18 year old freshman. I am currently majoring in ITM at IIT. I was born and raised in Chicago, Illinois though I can't say I know the city much other than the museums. I like going out with friends occasionally and making plans that somehow never happen because they are so grand. </p>

	    <h1>Anime Opening That Plays on Repeat</h1>
	  </div>
	    <p>At the moment there aren't any animes I'm watching except for Moriarty the Patriot. It has just started its second season so I'm hyped for that. The opening and the ending of the first season was really dope and its an absolute artistic masterpiece. Parts of the opening plays on repeat in my head along with certain parts of the second season's opening.</p>
